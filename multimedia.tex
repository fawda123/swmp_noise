A simple R package with a sample dataset and code to implement weighted regression is available on GitHub, including functions to estimate ecosystem metabolism.  See the README file on the web page for download instructions and examples (\href{https://github.com/fawda123/WtRegDO}{https://github.com/fawda123/WtRegDO}).  Interactive applications are also available that illustrate the weighting scheme described in the material and procedures section (\href{https://beckmw.shinyapps.io/weights_widget}{https://beckmw.shinyapps.io/weights\_widget}), results for each simulation (\href{https://beckmw.shinyapps.io/detiding_sims/}{https://beckmw.shinyapps.io/detiding\_sims/}), and results for each case study (\href{https://beckmw.shinyapps.io/detiding_cases/}{https://beckmw.shinyapps.io/detiding\_cases/}).  Each link is a graphical summary of data based on interactive inputs to support the results in the manuscript.
