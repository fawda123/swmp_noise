\section{Introduction} \label{intro}

Metabolism estimates from time series of dissolved oxygen provide integrated evaluations of trophic state in aquatic ecosystems \citep{Kemp12,Needoba12}.  Autotrophic or productive systems are characterized by high rates of energy transfer between trophic levels leading to accumulation organic matter, whereas heterotrophic systems are sinks of organic matter that are supported by allochthonous sources of energy input.  Integrated measures of metabolism describe the balance between production and respiration that accounts for varying rates in processes that create and consume organic matter.  Although metabolic rates vary naturally at multiple spatiotemporal scales \citep{Ziegler98,Caffrey04,Russell07}, anthropogenic stressors are generally accepted as contributing factors that increase rates of production \citep{Diaz08}.  Inputs of limiting nutrients beyond background concentrations may decrease the resilience of an ecosystem such that higher rates of production are coupled with higher biological oxygen demand \citep{Yin04,Kemp09}.  Cultural eutrophication is frequently linked to declines in water quality through lower levels of dissolved oxygen, degradation in aquatic vegetation habitat, and increased frequency of harmful algal blooms \citep{Cloern96,Short96,Rabalais02}.  Reliables estimates of ecosystem metabolism are critical for measuring both background rates of production and potential impacts of human activities on ecosytem condition.     

Ecosystem metabolism can be estimated using two basic techniques, each of which is appropriate under different conditions or assumptions \citep{Kemp12}.   Bottle-based techniques rely on rate measurements from discrete water quality samples, whereas open-water techniques infer metabolic rates using \textit{in situ} measurements from continuous monitoring data.  Bottle-based techniques are useful for direct partitioning of metabolic contributions into discrete habitats, such as planktonic production rates during specific time periods \citep{Kemp12}.  However, such measurements may be inappropriate for evaluating whole ecosystem metabolism if significant production occurs in habitats that are not sampled, such as benthic or seagrass production.  As such, the open-water technique provides an integrative measure of metabolism by inferring process rates from \textit{in situ}, continuous monitoring data.  Originally for use in streams \citep{Odum56}, the method has been used with varying success in lakes \citep{Staehr10,Coloso11,Batt12} and estuaries \citep{Caffrey04,Hopkinson05,Caffrey13}.  As with any method, the ability of the open-water technique to accurately estimate whole system metabolism depends on whether the assumptions for its use are met.  Such assumptions are are often only implicity verified in practice, leading to potential biases.  The increasing availability of high resolution monitoring data further necessitates more quantitative assessments of the open-water technique.

The open-water method uses the diel fluctuation of dissolved oxygen to infer rates of ecosytem metabolism, after correcting for losses or gains through air-water exchange \citep{Kemp12}.  Daily integrated measurements of metabolism are based on the balance between daytime estimates of gross production and nighttime estimates of respiration extrapolated to a 24 hour period.  The fundamental assumption of the open-water method is that measurements come from a water mass that has the same recent history \citep{Needoba12}.  Estimates of metabolism from a single location may be inaccurate if substantial variation in water column mixing occurs throughout the period of observation \citep{Russell07}.  As such, the original technique designed for use in streams requires the comparison of data from an upstream and downstream station \citep{Odum56}.  Application of the method to systems without continuous flow, such as lakes or estuaries, have often assumed that a single sampling station provides sufficient data for estimating metabolism \cite{Staehr10}.  While single stations may be valid under specific conditions, numerous studies have shown that the open-water method may be inappropriate given the effects of physical mixing \citep{Ziegler98,Caffrey03,Coloso11,Batt12,Nidzieko14}.

The open-water method has been applied to coastal ecosystems with mixed success.  An exhaustive analysis by \citet{Caffrey03} applied the method to estimate metabolim at 28 continuous monitoring stations at 14 US estuaries.  Data from two of the reserves were used to evaluate the assumption of homogeneity of water masses measured by each sensor.  Although significant differences were not observed for metabolism estimates between adjacent stations, the analysis was based on a comparison of means using conventional significance tests rather than a systematic comparison of time series.  Moreover, a portion of metabolism estimates from all stations were negative for production during the day and positive for respiration during the night.  These values were opposite in sign than expected since production increases oxygen during the day (i.e., positive effect on metabolism) and respiration consumes oxygen at night (i.e., negative effect on metabolism).  These `anamolous' values were attributed to violations in the assumption of water-column heterogeneity, particularly in relation to tidal advection. 

The effects of tidal advection on estimates of ecosystem metabolism have been a point of concern in numerous studies \citep{Monbet92,Ziegler98,Caffrey03,Collins13,Howarth14}, although systematic estimates of its effects in tidal systems have been minimal.  An exception is \citet{Nidzieko14} that described quantitative assessment of the effects of fortnightly tidal modulations on metabolism estimates.  Using a control volume approach to measure fluxes into and out of a shallow tidal creek, significant biases in metabolism estimates were observed.  Net heterotrophy was observed during spring tides, whereas metabolism was balanced during neap tides.  The timing of irradiance relative to the tidal cycle was a primary factor contributing to heterotrophy during summer months such that maximum tides occurred during the night, increasing total area for respiration.  The results of the analysis, although specific to the study location, suggest that the effects of tidal advection on \ac{DO} measurements are of primary concern when selecting locations and length of time for sonde deployment in estuaries.  In many cases, the relative magnitude of these effects may be a significant source of bias.  Analytical techniques to evaluate and correct for tidal advection could improve certainty in metabolism estimates and increase the use of data from shorter deployment periods if sources of bias are quantified and removed.       

This article describes the theory and application of a novel method for detiding an observed \ac{DO} time series to more accurately quantify estimates of ecosystem metabolim for estuaries.  Specifically, the method characterizes the effects of tidal advection on \ac{DO} observations to improve estimates of open-water metabolism with multi-year time series of high frequency ($<$ one hour) water quality data.  The focus of our analysis is the use of a weighted regression method previously developed for trend analysis of pollutant concentrations in streams and rivers \citep{Hirsch10} and recently adapted for trend evaluation of water quality in estuaries \citepalias{BeckIR}.  The weighted regression approach creates dynamic predictions of \ac{DO} as a function of time and tidal height change, which are then used to normalize, or detide, the \ac{DO} signal.  First, we use a simulation approach to create time series of \ac{DO} observations with known characteristics to evaluate ability of the weighted regression to remove the effects of tidal advection.  Second, four case studies from the \aclu{NERRS} (\acs{NERRS}, \citealt{Wenner04}) are used to validate the method for improving estimates of ecosystem metabolism.  Overall, the analysis is meant to improve the certainty of information obtained from monitoring data by evaluating the relative roles of biological and physical processes in estuarine systems.  Applications are expected to have implications for ecosystem management by outlining strategies for interpreting water quality data with more accuracy.

\section{Materials and Procedures}

\subsection{Weighted regression for modelling and detiding \ac{DO} time series}

The weighted regression model for detiding \ac{DO} time series was adapted from the \ac{WRTDS} method developed by \citet{Hirsch10}.  The \ac{WRTDS} method was developed to model pollutant concentration in streams and normalize predictions to changes in discharge.  The functional form of our model is as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{funform}
DO_{obs}= \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \beta_2 H
\end{equation}
where observed \ac{DO} is a linear function of decimal time $t$ and astronomical tidal height $H$. Decimal time is a continuous variable for the day and time of each obervation with time as a proportion of the number of total observations added to each day.  The beginning of each day was considered the nearest thirty minute observation (i.e., on the hour and half hour) at which sunrise was expected for a given location and time of year.  Days were centered on the diel cycle rather than conventional times given that the objective was to develop a predictive model relevant for biological \ac{DO} variation that follows solar and seasonal cycles.  The functional form also differed from the original \ac{WRTDS} method that included parameters to estimate variation of the response variable on a sinuisoidal period.  \ac{DO} variation was not modeled using this approach because rates of change may be abrupt following diurnal variation in irradiance or daily \ac{DO} variation may be muted given the weather, as on cloudy days.

Weighted regression is implemented as a moving window that allows for estimation of \ac{DO} throughout the time series by adapting to variation through time as a function of tide. Regression models are estimated sequentially for each observation in the time series using dynamic weight vectors that change with the center of the window.  Weight vectors quantify the relevance of observations to the center of the window in respect to decimal time, hour of the day, and tidal height.  Specifically, weights are assigned using a tri-cube weighting function \citep{Hirsch10}:
\begin{equation}
w= \left\{ 
  \begin{array}{l l}
    \left(1-\left(d/h\right)^3\right)^3 & \quad \textrm{if } |d| \leq h \\
    0 & \quad \textrm{if } |d| > h 
  \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
where the weight $w$ of each observation is inversely proportional to the distance $d$ from the center of the window such that observations more similar to the point of reference are given higher importance in the regression.  Weights exceeding the maximum width of the window $h$ are equal to zero.  The tri-cube weighting function is similar to a normal distribution such that weights decrease gradually from the center until the maximum window width is reached.  Observations that are half the distance from the center of the window to the maximum window width are weighted one third less than values at the center.  Regressions that use simpler windows (e.g., boxcar approach) are  more sensitive to influential observations as they enter or leave the window, whereas the tri-cube function minimizes their effect through gradual weighting of observations from the center \citep{Hirsch10}.  The weight vector for each observation is the product of three separate weight vectors for decimal time, hour, and tidal height. A low weight is given to an observation if any of the three weighting values were not similar to the center of the window since the final weight vector is the product of three weight vectors for each variable (see the link in the \hyperref[multi]{multimedia} section for graphical display of different weights).    

A nontrivial issue with weighted regression is the choice of window width for calculating weights.  Excessively large or small window widths may respectively under- or over-fit the data.  Additionally, optimal window widths may depend on the objective for using the model.  The weighted regression approach can be used for both predicting \ac{DO} and normalizing to remove the variance in the \ac{DO} signal from tidal changes.  Optimal window widths that minimize prediction error or fit to the observed data are typically smaller than the optimum window widths for normalizing the time series.  Similarly, window widths that more effectively detide the \ac{DO} signal may produce predictions for the observed data that are not optimal.  Evaluations of the weighted regression method with simulated \ac{DO} time series, described below, used different window widths to identify an approximate optimal window width for detiding the \ac{DO} signal.  As such, the ability of the models to predict observed \ac{DO} was not a primary concern given that the optimal window width for detiding likely corresponds to a model that predicts \ac{DO} as a function of tide rather than observed \ac{DO} as a function of both tide and biological variation.  

\subsection{Detiding the \ac{DO} signal using weighted regression}

The primary objective of the analysis was to evaluate ability of the weighted regression method to detide a \ac{DO} signal to obtain more accurate estimates of metabolism.  \citet{Hirsch10} developed the normalization approach for the \ac{WRTDS} method using a two-dimensional interpolation grid that contains predicted values of pollutant concentrations across the time series and the range of stream discharge values observed in the study system \citep{Hirsch10}.  Normalized values for pollutant concentration are obtained by averaging the model predictions across the discharge values that are likely to occur on a given day to provide an estimate that is independent of flow variation.    

Predicted values of \ac{DO} concentration were normalized to remove variation from tidal height changes, although the approach herein differs slightly from \citet{Hirsch10}.  Our approach uses weighted regression to isolate sources of variation in the observed \ac{DO} signal that are related to unique effects of tidal height and biological process (\cref{fig:do_dtd}).  Two sets of values are predicted for the observed time series $DO_{obs}$, rather than creating an interpolation grid.  The first set of values uses the tidal height of an observation and second set uses the mean tidal height across the time series, $DO_{tid}$ and $DO_{nrm}$ respectively.  In other words, the first set of predictions represent \ac{DO} as a function of time and tide, where the second set represents \ac{DO} conditional on time and mean tidal height:
\begin{equation} \label{do_tid}
DO_{tid} = f(DO_{obs}|H, t)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{do_nrm}
DO_{nrm} = f(DO_{obs}|\bar{H}, t)
\end{equation}

\section{Assessment}

\subsection{Simulation of \ac{DO} time series}

The ability of the weighted regression to detide the \ac{DO} signal was evaluated first using a simulation approach.  Observed \ac{DO} time series were created to represent the sum of variation from biological processes and physical effects related to tidal advection:  
\begin{equation} \label{do_obs}
DO_{obs} = DO_{bio} + DO_{adv}
\end{equation}
Biological \ac{DO} signals are inherently noisy \citep{Batt12} and can be further described as:
\begin{equation} \label{do_bio} 
DO_{bio} = DO_{die} + DO_{unc}
\end{equation} 
\begin{equation} \label{do_unc}
DO_{unc} = \epsilon_{obs} + \epsilon_{proc}
\end{equation}
where the biological \ac{DO} signal is the sum of diel variation on a 24 hour scale plus uncertainty or noise.  Total uncertainty in the biological \ac{DO} signal is described as variation from observation and process uncertainty \citep{Hilborn97}.  Multiple time series at 30 minute observations over 30 days were created following \cref{do_obs,do_bio,do_unc} such that observed \ac{DO} is generalized as the additive combination of four time series (\cref{fig:do_sim}):
\begin{equation} \label{do_obs_all}
DO_{obs} = DO_{adv} + DO_{die} + \epsilon_{obs} + \epsilon_{pro}
\end{equation}
Time series were created by varying the relative magnitudes of each of the four components of observed \ac{DO} to test the effectiveness of weighted regression under different scenarios.  The effects of air-sea gas exchange were not considered in the simulation given that methods are available for \textit{in situ} data to correct observed \ac{DO} for diffusion \citep[i.e., ][]{Thebault08}.  

Each parameter of the simulated time series was created as follows. First, biological \ac{DO} time series in \cref{do_bio} were created by adding noise or variance to a diel component (\cref{fig:do_sim}).  The diel component, $DO_{die}$, was estimated using a sine/cosine function \citep{Cryer08}:
\begin{equation} \label{do_sin}
DO_{die} = \alpha + \beta\cos\left(2\pi ft + \Phi\right)
\end{equation}
such that the mean DO $\alpha$ was 8, amplitude $\beta$ was 1, $f$ was 1/48 to repeat on a 24 hour period every 30 minutes, $t$ was the time series vector and $\Phi$ was the x-axis origin set for an arbitrary sunrise at 630am.  The diel signal was increasing during the day and decreasing during the night for each 24 hour period and ranged from 7 to 9 mg L$^{-1}$.  Noise or uncertainty was added to the diel \ac{DO} signal to simulate natural variation in \ac{DO} throughout the time series (\cref{fig:do_sim}).  Total uncertainty was the sum of observation and process uncertainty for $n = 1440$ (30 minutes by 30 days) observations \citep{Hilborn97}, such that:
\begin{equation} \label{do_unc_n}
DO_{unc, n} = \epsilon_{obs, n} + \int_{t = 1}^{n} \epsilon_{pro, t}
\end{equation}
where observation and process uncertainty ($\epsilon_{obs}$, $\epsilon_{pro}$) were simulated as normally distributed random variables with mean zero and standard deviation varying from zero to an upper limit, described below.  To induce auto-correlation, process uncertainty was estimated as the cumulative sum of $n$ observations where the noise at time $t+1$ was equal to the noise at time $t$ plus additional variation drawn from the normal distribution.  The noise vector for process uncertainty was rescaled to constrain the variation within the bounds for standard deviation defined by the random variable. The total uncertainty, $DO_{unc}$, was added to the diel \ac{DO} time series to create the biological \ac{DO} time series (\cref{fig:do_sim}).

A semidiurnal tidal series was simulated as a sine wave with a period of 12.5 hours to approximate the principal lunar component \citep{Foreman89}.  The amplitude was set to 1 meter and centered  at 4 meters.  Initial assessments indicated that tide type (i.e., diurnal, semidiurnal, mixed) did not signifcantly affect the outcome of the results and a semidiurnal time series was used to reduce the total number of simulations.  The tidal time series was added to the biological \ac{DO} series to simulate \ac{DO} changes with advection, $DO_{adv}$ (\cref{fig:do_sim}). Conceptually, this vector represents the rate of change in \ac{DO} as a function of horizontal water movement from tidal advection such that:
\begin{equation} \label{deltdo}
\frac{\delta DO_{adv}}{\delta t} = \frac{\delta DO}{\delta x} \cdot \frac{\delta x}{\delta t}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{deltx}
\frac{\delta x}{\delta t} = k \cdot \frac{\delta H}{\delta t}
\end{equation}
where the first derivative of the tidal time series, as change in height over time $\delta H / \delta t$, is multiplied by a constant $k$, to estimate horizontal tidal excursion over time, $\delta x / \delta t$.  The horizontal excursion is assumed to be associated with a horizontal \ac{DO} change, $\delta DO / \delta x$, such that the product of the two estimates the \ac{DO} change at each time step from advection, $DO_{adv}$. In practice, the simulated tidal signal was used to estimate $DO_{adv}$:
\begin{equation} \label{do_advp}
DO_{adv} \propto H
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{do_adv}
DO_{adv} = 2\cdot a + a \cdot \frac{H- \min H}{\max H - \min H}
\end{equation}
where $a$ is analogous to $k$ in \cref{deltx} and is chosen as the transformation parameter to standardize change in \ac{DO} from tidal height change to desired units.  For example, $a = 1$ will convert $H$ to a scale that simulates changes in \ac{DO} from tidal advection that range from +/- 1 mg L$^{-1}$.  The final time series for observed \ac{DO} was the sum of biological \ac{DO} and advection \ac{DO} (\cref{fig:do_sim}).

\subsection{Evaluation of weighted regression with simulated \ac{DO} time series}

Multiple time series were simulated by varying the conditions in \cref{do_obs,do_bio,do_unc,do_obs_all,do_sin,do_unc_n,deltdo,deltx,do_advp,do_adv}. Specifically, the simulated data varied in the relative amount of noise in the measurement, relative amplitude of the diel \ac{DO} component, and degree of association of the tide with the \ac{DO} signal.  Three levels were evaluated for each variable: relative noise as 0, 1, and 2 standard deviations for both process and observation uncertainty, amplitude of diel biological \ac{DO} as 0, 1, and 2 mg L$^{-1}$, and \ac{DO} change from tidal advection as 0, 1, and 2 mg L$^{-1}$. A total of 81 time series were created based on the unique combinations of parameters (\cref{fig:sim_ex}).  Three half window widths for each variable (day, hour of day, and tide height) were evaluated: decimal time as 1, 3, and 6 days, time of day as 1, 3, and 6 hours, and tidal height as 0.25, 0.5, and 1 as a proportion of the observed value at the center of the window.  The window widths were chosen based on preliminary assessments that suggested variation in model performance was adequately captured by these values.  In total, 27 window width combinations were evaluated for each of 81 simulated time series, producing results for 2187 weighted regressions.

The detided or normalized values for each regression were compared to the simulated data to evaluate the ability of weighted regression to reproduce the biological \ac{DO} signals. Results were summarized using Pearson correlation coefficients and the \ac{RMSE} between the detided time series and the biological \ac{DO} time series as a known component of the observed.  Overall, the weighted regressions provided accurate results for the detided time series compared to the `true' biological time series regardless of the simulation parameters (\cref{tab:dtd_perf1}) or window widths (\cref{tab:dtd_perf2}).  Results for each simulation can be viewed using the link in the \hyperref[multi]{multimedia} section.  Mean correlation for all time series and window widths between the detided and biological values was 0.60, with values ranging from -0.78 to 1.00.  Mean error was 1.21, with values ranging from 0.00 to 2.40.  Simulations with very poor performance (e.g., negative correlations) were those that had minimum widths for day windows and maximum widths for hour windows, or were those with the \ac{DO} signal composed entirely of noise from observation uncertainty. Conversely, simulations with detided time series that were identical to the true time series (e.g., correlation of one, \ac{RMSE} of zero) were those for which there was no biological or tidal influence.  While the latter examples do not represent real-world scenarios, they were included in the simulations to provide verification that the weighted regression provided reasonable results given extremes.  

Characteristics of \ac{DO} time series that contributed to improved model performance were increasing amplitude of the diel \ac{DO} component ($DO_{die}$) and increasing process uncertainty ($e_{pro}$), whereas increasing observation uncertainty contributed to decreasing performance (\cref{tab:dtd_perf1,fig:err_surf1}).  Model performance was minimally influenced by magnitude of the tidal advection component ($DO_{adv}$), although performance decreased slightly with increasing tidal effects.  Increasing widths for day and tidal proportion windows contributed to increasing model performance, whereas the opposite was true for increasing hour windows (\cref{tab:dtd_perf2,err_surf2}).  Graphical summaries of model performance by simulation parameters (\cref{fig:err_surf1}) and half window widths (\cref{fig:err_surf2}) support the general trends described by \cref{tab:dtd_perf1,tab:dtd_perf2}.  Scale differences between \cref{fig:err_surf1} and \cref{fig:err_surf2} emphasize that model performance was more affected by characteristics of the \ac{DO} time series rather than the selected window widths.  For example, the range of correlation values comparing the effects of half window widths (averaged across all simulation parameters, \cref{fig:err_surf2}) were approximately half the range of correlations for comparing the effects of simulation parameters (averaged across all half window widths, \cref{fig:err_surf1}).
 
\subsection{Validation of weighted regression with case studies}

\ac{NERRS} is a federally-funded network of 28 protected estuaries established for long-term research, water-quality monitoring, education, and coastal stewardship \citep{Wenner04}.  Continuous water quality data have been collected at \ac{NERRS} sites since 1994 through the \ac{SWMP}.  In addition to providing a basis for trend evaluation, data from \ac{SWMP} provides an ideal opportunity to evaluate long-term variation in water quality parameters attributed to both biological and physical processes.  Continuous \ac{SWMP} data can be used to describe \ac{DO} variation at sites with different characteristics, including variation from ranges in tidal regime \citep{Sanger02} and rates of ecosystem production \citep{Caffrey03,Caffrey04}.  

Continuous \ac{DO} time series and tidal height measurements at four sites from the \ac{SWMP} database \citepalias{CDMO14} were used to validate the detiding model with real data.  Monitoring data from January 1\textsuperscript{st} to December 31\textsuperscript{st} 2012 were obtained from a range of geographic locations (\cref{fig:case_map,tab:case_att}). Astronomical tidal heights were predicted for each site using harmonic regression applied to the sonde depth data (\texttt{oce} package in R, \citealt{Foreman89}, \citetalias{RDCT14}). Although, the depth data represent tidal height variation from both astronomical (i.e., gravitational effects) and meteorological (e.g., wind, precipitation inflows) sources, we isolated the former given that daily metabolism estimates were more likely to be affected by repeated diel cycling from normal tidal changes.  Each station was also chosen based on high correlations between \ac{DO} and tidal changes.  The four sites included the Vierra Mouth station at Elkhorn Slough (California, 36.81$^{\circ}$N, 121.78$^{\circ}$W), Bayview Channel at Padilla Bay (Washington, 48.50$^{\circ}$N 122.50$^{\circ}$W), Middle Blackwater River station at Rookery Bay (Florida, 25.93$^{\circ}$N 81.60$^{\circ}$W), and Dean Creek station at Sapelo Island (Georgia, 31.39$^{\circ}$N 81.28$^{\circ}$W).  The stations are generally macrotidal semidiurnal or mixed semidiurnal and net heterotrophic on an annual basis.  Net heterotrophy (i.e., respiration exceeding production) is typical for shallow water systems at temperate latitudes \citep{Caffrey03}, although values in \cref{tab:case_att} are from observed \ac{DO} time series that are strongly influenced by tidal advection.

\subsection{Estimates of ecosystem metabolism before and after detiding} \label{met_sec}

The weighted regression method was applied to the time series for each station to obtain a detided \ac{DO} time series for estimating metabolism.  Half window widths of six days, one hour, and a tidal proportion of one half were chosen based on a balance between large and small window widths, although we recognize that the chosen widths are somewhat arbitrary and a more exhaustive evaluation should be conducted prior to using the results to inform management actions. Unlike the simulated data, the true biological \ac{DO} signal was unknown for the case studies.  Accordingly, results were evaluated  using correlations of \ac{DO} and metabolism estimates with tidal height before and after application of the model.  Results were also evaluated based on the occurrence of `anomalous' daily production or respiration estimates, where anomalous was defined as negative production during the day and positive respiration estimates during the night.  Anomalous values have been previously attributed to the effects of physical processes on \ac{DO} time series \citep{Caffrey03}.  We hypothesized that metabolism esimates using the detided signal would contain less `anomalous' values than those from the observed \ac{DO} time series.  Although anomalies could be caused by processes other than tidal advection, e.g., abiotic dark oxygen production \citep{Pamatmat97}, we assume that physical processes are the dominant sources of these values.  

Ecosystem metabolism was estimated from the \ac{DO} time series using the open-water technique \citep{Odum56} as described in \citet{Caffrey13}.  The method is used to infer net ecosystem metabolism using the mass balance equation:
\begin{equation} \label{metrate}
\frac{\delta DO}{\delta t} = P - R + D
\end{equation}
where the change in \ac{DO} concentration ($\delta DO$, g O$_2$ m$^{-3}$) over time ($\delta t$, hours) is equal to photosynthetic rate ($P$, g O$_2$ m$^{-3}$ hr$^{-1}$) minus respiration rate ($R$, g O$_2$ m$^{-3}$ hr$^{-1}$), corrected for air-sea gas exchange at the interface ($D$, g O$_2$ m$^{-3}$ hr$^{-1}$) \citep{Caffrey13}. $D$ is estimated as the difference between the \ac{DO} saturation concentration and observed \ac{DO}, multiplied by a volumetric reaeration coefficient, $k_a$ \citep{Thebault08}.  The diffusion-corrected \ac{DO} flux estimates were averaged during day and night for each 24 hour period in the time series, where flux is an hourly rate of \ac{DO} change as the difference between observations at time $t$ and $t+1$.  Areal respiration rates were assumed constant during the night and substracted from daily gross production estimates to yield net ecosystem metabolism (\cref{tab:case_att}).  

Detiding had significant effects on the correlations between tidal height changes, \ac{DO} time series, and metabolism estimates (\cref{tab:cor_res}).  Correlations of observed \ac{DO} time series with predicted tidal height were highly significant, with all sites indicating positive relationships, except Padilla Bay where tidal increases were associated with declines in \ac{DO}  concentration.  This suggests that seaward water masses were less anoxic than landward masses, with the opposite being true for Padilla Bay. The detided \ac{DO} time series had greatly reduced correlations with tidal height, although relationships were still significant after detiding likely because of the large sample size for each site (n $\approx$ 17500). Metabolism estimates before and after detiding were compared to the mean rate of tidal height change (i.e., first derivative of the predicted tidal height) for each day during separate solar periods.  Production rates were compared to mean rates of tidal height change during the day, respiration rates were compared to mean rates of change during the night, and net metabolism rates were compared to mean rates of change for the total 24 hour period each day.  Comparison of metabolic rates to tidal changes before and after detiding produced inconsistent results (\cref{tab:cor_res}).  Correlations for Elkhorn Slough and Sapelo Island showed consistent reductions in all three metabolims estimates after detiding.  Correlations for Padilla Bay and Rookery Bay were of opposite sign and greater magnitude after detiding for production and respiration, although net metabolism estimates had reduced correlations.  

The percent of daily integrated metabolism estimates that were anomalous (negative production, positive respiration) were significantly reduced for most sites after detiding (\cref{tab:case_res}).  Before detiding, anomalous values ranged from 0.09 (Rookery Bay) to 0.22 (Padilla Bay) for production and 0.08 (Rookery Bay) to 0.21 (Elkhorn Slough) for respiration as proportions of the daily estimates. Anomalous values were reduced to near zero for Rookery Bay and Sapelo Island, by approximately half for Padilla Bay (0.13 for production, 0.13 for respiration), and only slightly reduced for Elkhorn Slough (0.17 for production, 0.17 for respiration).  Metabolism estimates using detided \ac{DO} time series had decreased mean production and respiration for Elkhorn Slough, increased mean production and respiration for Padilla Bay, and generally unchanged mean production and respiration for Rookery Bay and Sapelo Island (\cref{tab:case_res}).  Mean net ecosystem metabolism was unchanged for all sites.  Decreases in the standard erorr for all metabolism estimates (production, respiration, and net) were observed for all cases after detiding.  Graphical results for each case study can be viewed using the link in the \hyperref[multi]{multimedia} section.  

An example from Sapelo Island illustrates the effects of weighted regression on \ac{DO} and metabolism estimates (\cref{fig:phase_out,fig:phase_in,fig:case_ex}).   A two-week period in February shows when the tidal changes were both in and out of phase with the diel cycling.  The first week illustrates a period of observation when maximum tide heights are generally out of phase with the diel cycle such that low tides are observed during the middle of the night and the middle of the day (\cref{fig:phase_in}).  The second week illustrates when the maximum tide height occurs during the day and night (\cref{fig:phase_in}).  The effects of tidal height change on the observed \ac{DO} time series are visually apparent in the plots.  Maximum or minimum tidal heights also occur when the contributions of respiration and production are largest (i.e., mid-day or mid-night). The first example illustrates a strong negative bias (less respiration, less production) in the observed \ac{DO} signal from low tides, whereas the second example illustrates a strong positive bias (more respiraiton, more production) in the observed \ac{DO} from high tides. These biases are apparent in the metabolism estimates based on the observed data (\cref{fig:case_ex}).  Anomalous estimates occur when low tides are in phase with the solar cycle, whereas metabolism estimates are likely over-estimated when high tides are in phase with the solar cycle.  The detided time series shows noticeable changes given the direction of bias associated with tidal height and diel period.  \ac{DO} values were higher after detiding when low tides occurred during night and day periods, whereas \ac{DO} values were lower after detiding when high tides occurred during day and night periods.  Changes in metabolism estimates after detiding were also apparent, such that the anomalous values were removed during the first week and the positive bias in the second week is decreased.  Detiding had similar effects for the remaining sites, particularly when tidal changes were in or out of phase with diel periods. 

\subsection{Effects of aggregation and importance of detiding}

A final point of concern is the period of observation within which observed \ac{DO} is affected by tidal height changes and the extent to which this affects the interpretation of ecosystem metabolism.  From a management or ecological perspective, the effects of tidal variatoin on daily estimates may not be a primary concern given that seasonal or annual rates may be more relevant for evaluating ecosystem dynamics with continuous monitoring data.  The example from Sapelo Island in the previous section further highlights this point given that mean production and respiration estimates before and after detidng were generally unchanged for the two-week period. \cref{tab:case_res} also indicated that mean annual estimates of production and respiration were unchanged for Rookery Bay and Sapelo Island, whereas production and respiration estimates were significantly different at both mean annual and daily time scales for Elkhorn Slough and Padilla Bay. Although we acknowledge that the specific results may be related to the window widths, this suggests that detiding may contribute to changes in metabolic estimates that are aggregated on longer time periods.  Therefore, an evaluation of the effects of tidal variation on ecosystem metabolism for different periods of observation is critical for understanding practical implications of weighted regression.  Specifically, when should detiding be applied if aggregation of observed data on longer time periods removes potential bias?  A comparison of observed and detided estimates that are aggregated over different periods of observation (e.g., annual, seasonal, monthly) could help address this question.

The observed and detided daily estimates were averaged by month and season (Fall, Spring, Summer, and Winter) for each case study to evaluate effects of aggregation on mean production and respiration estimates (\cref{fig:metab_sum1,fig:metab_sum2}).  Mean annual estimates in \cref{tab:case_res} also provided a basis of comparison with monthly and seasonal aggregation. Significant variation in aggregated production and respiration estimates for month and season was observed for each case study.  Detided production and respiration estimates for Padilla Bay and Rookery Bay exhibited seasonal and monthly variation that was more characteristic of expected trends with increases in metabolism during warmer months.  Specifically, production estimates based on observed \ac{DO} were substantially muted for both Padilla Bay (\cref{fig:metab_sum1}) and Rookery Bay (\cref{fig:metab_sum2}) during summer months, whereas values were significantly higher based on the detided data. Results for Sapelo Island suggested that winter and summer months were under- and over-estimated, respectively, based on the observed data.  Results for Elkhorn Slough varied significantly such that production and respiration were significantly reduced after detiding regardless of the aggregation period.  Overall, these trends emphasize the importance of considering different aggregation periods for interpreting metabolism estimates.  Each case study showed differences in observed and detided values at monthly and seasonal aggregations, whereas only two of the four case studies had mean aggregated estimates that were substantially different (Elkhorn Slough and Padilla Bay, \cref{tab:case_res}).  Periods of observation as long as one year may include significant sources of bias from tidal advection, suggesting the need for applying weighted regression.

\section{Discussion}

The primary objective for development and application of the weighted regression technique was to provide a method for more accurately estimating ecosystem metabolism by removing bias associated with tidal change in observed \ac{DO} time series.  The application of weighted regression to simulated \ac{DO} time series with known characteristics and extension to continuous monitoring data from selected \ac{NERRS} sites provided a proof-of-concept that the method can isolate and remove variation in observed \ac{DO} from tidal change.  Further, aggregation of metabolism estimates using the detided \ac{DO} time series were significantly different than those using the observed data, particularly for relatively long periods of observation. These results suggest that previous estimates of annual means may not accurately reflect true metabolic signals if the effects of tidal variation confound biological signals in observed \ac{DO} time series.  Additionally, variation of mean estimates was substantially reduced for estimates based on detided \ac{DO} time series, suggesting that the certainty of conclusions from detided estimates can be improved even if the mean annual estimates do not change.  Monitoring data for periods of observation less than one year may also produce biased metabolism estimates if observed data are not detided.  Results for each case study showed that significant differences were observed for the detided data at seasonal and monthly aggregations, particularly during summer months for Padilla Bay and Rookery Bay.  

Comparisons between detided and biological \ac{DO} time series from the simulations indicated that adequate results can be obtained from the weighted regression for a range of characteristics of \ac{DO} time series, as well as half window widths used in the regression.  An examination of scenarios that produced abnormal results can provide additional insight into factors that affect the performance of weighted regression.  For example, poor performance was observed when the observation uncertainty ($\epsilon_{obs}$) was high and both process uncertainty ($\epsilon_{pro}$) and tidal advection ($DO_{adv}$) were low.  These examples represent time series with excessive random variation, no auto-correlation, and no tidal influence.  Poor performance is expected because the weighted regression models a non-existent tidal signal in a very noisy \ac{DO} time series.  These results were observed even for time series with a large diel component of the biological \ac{DO} signal, suggesting that the model will produce unreliable results in microtidal systems with high noise and no serial correlation.  From a practical perspective, weighted regression should not be applied to noisy time series if there is not sufficient evidence to suggest the variation is related to tidal changes.  Similarly, results with perfect or near-perfect correlations between detided and biological \ac{DO} time series were observed when observation uncertainy and tidal advection effects were not in the simulated time series.  Although there is no logical basis for applying weighted regression to time series with no apparent tidal influences, the results will be as expected, as was true for cases with low tidal advection, high observation uncertainty, and low process uncertainty.  We emphasize that the weighted regression should only be applied to time series for which specific conditions apply, as described below.  

The performance metrics used to evaluate weighted regression with the case studies suggested that detiding provided more accuate estimates of ecosystem metabolism.  Correlations of metabolism estimates with tidal height changes after detiding were generally reduced, although trends were not always consistent as correlations were reduced in some cases (Sapelo Island) or reversed in others (Padilla Bay).  However, correlations of net metabolism estimates were reduced in all cases.  Tidal height change provides a proxy measure for horizontal advection that directly affects the measured rate of change of oxygen.  Further, changes in \ac{DO} concentration represent integrated measures of both production and respiration (\cref{metrate}).  The inconsistent results in \cref{tab:cor_res} are potentially related to the effects of horizontal advection on the integrated \ac{DO} signal, given that production and respiration each represent a unique component of the diel \ac{DO} variation that is directly affected by tidal variation.  Regardless, the proportion of anomalous metabolism estimates was reduced by detiding for all case studies, although this measure may also be an incomplete indication of the combined effects of tidal variation.  Negative production and positive respiration estimates suggest assumptions of the open-water method are violated \citep{Needoba12}, whereas `normal' estimates (positive production and negative respiration) may still include a significant source of bias from physical advection by providing over-estimates of true values.  For example, \citet{Nidzieko14} observed that net metabolism at Elkhorn Slough was more often heterotrophic during maximum spring tides that occurred at nighttime, as a substantially larger area of salt marsh was inundated leading to higher respiration estimates.  Although this result supports our general conclusions, a broader discussion regarding whether or not this represents a bias in metabolism from physical advection may be needed. 

A strength of the weighted regression approach is the lack of assumptions for describing the relationships between \ac{DO} and tidal variation over time.  Although the functional form of the model is a simple linear regression with two explanatory variables (\cref{funform}), the moving window approach combined with the adaptive weighting scheme allows for quantification of complex tidal effects that may not be possible using alternative approaches.  For example, \citet{Batt12} described the use of a moving window or Kalman filter to improve estimates of ecosystem metabolism in lakes.  The approach minimizes the influences of process and observation uncertainty on observed \ac{DO} time series, which is attributed to the effects of water movement on metabolic signals.  Although a similar approach may be useful for estuaries if process and observation uncertainty are the only sources of variation in the \ac{DO} series, the weighted regression approach is more appropriate if tidal advection is the primary confounding factor.  Additionally, results from the case studies illustrated the ability of the weighted regression approach to model changes over time in the relationships between tidal change and \ac{DO}.  Results for Padilla Bay and Rookery Bay suggested that detiding had the largest effect during the summer, whereas the results for cooler months were not significantly different from the observed.  The weighted regression method produced detided time series that accommodated seasonal variation in \ac{DO} conditional on tidal height change, whereas moving window filters or standard regression techniques would likely not have characterized these dynamic relationships.

\section{Comments and recommendations}

Results from the simulations and case studies suggested that weighted regression can be a practical approach for detiding \ac{DO} time series to remove the effects of physical advection on estimates of ecosystem metabolism.  However, application of the method may only be appropriate under specific situations.  The case studies were chosen based on the expected influence of tidal variaiton given the relatively high proportion of metabolism estimates that were anomalous and the strength of correlation between the observed \ac{DO} time series and tidal height.  Despite these similarites among the case studies, detiding had variable effects on metabolism estimates.  The results for Elkhorn Slough and Padilla Bay are particular cause for concern given that mean annual estimates were substantially different compared to those from the observed \ac{DO} time series.  Although the correlation of \ac{DO} and tidal height was reduced for both cases, in addition to a reduction of anomalous estimates, the relative change in mean metabolism before and after detiding suggests a more careful evaluation of the method is needed.  In particular, optimal window widths should be chosen based on the ability to remove tidal effects while preserving the biological signal.  

The case studies emphasize a critical challenge in evaluating the effects of physical advection: the true biological signal is not known, or more appropriately, the relative contribution of horizontal advection to bias is not accuratley quantified.  Comparative analyses between systems with varying tidal influence or within-system evaluations of multiple sites at fixed distances are necessary to further validate performance of weighted regression.  Regardless, the current analysis suggests the method is potentially useful and we propose a precautionary approach for its application pending further validation.  Weighted regression should only be applied at macrotidal sites with strong evidence of the confounding effects of tidal advection on biological signals.  A weight-of-evidence approach should be used such that the occurrence of anomalous metabolism estimates, strong correlations between observed \ac{DO} and tide height, and clear visual patterns of tide change on \ac{DO} would suggest detiding is appropriate.  The choice of window widths may also produce varying results.  Optimal widths may be those that indicate a reduction of anomalous estimates, reduction in daily variation of production and respiration, and a reduction of the correlation between \ac{DO} and tide.  Results from window widths that produce large changes in the mean annual estimates should interpreted with caution.  In general, a pragmatic approach is emphasized such that results should be evaluated based on the preservation of diel variation related to production while exhibiting minimal changes with the tide.  Such an approach, combined with further validation, will support informed management decisions through more accurate estimates of ecosystem metabolism.
