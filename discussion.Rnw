The primary objective for development and application of the weighted regression technique was to provide a method for more accurately estimating ecosystem metabolism by removing bias associated with tidal change in observed \ac{DO} time series.  The application of weighted regression to simulated \ac{DO} time series with known characteristics and extension to continuous monitoring data from selected \ac{NERRS} sites provided a proof-of-concept that the method can isolate and remove variation in observed \ac{DO} from tidal change.  Further, aggregation of metabolism estimates using the detided \ac{DO} time series were significantly different than those using the observed data, particularly for relatively long periods of observation. These results suggest that previous estimates of annual means may not accurately reflect true metabolic signals if the effects of tidal variation confound biological signals in observed \ac{DO} time series.  Additionally, variation of mean estimates was substantially reduced for estimates based on detided \ac{DO} time series, suggesting that the certainty of conclusions from detided estimates can be improved even if the mean annual estimates do not change.  Monitoring data for periods of observation less than one year may also produce biased metabolism estimates if observed data are not detided.  Results for each case study showed that significant differences were observed for the detided data at seasonal and monthly aggregations, particularly during summer months for Padilla Bay and Rookery Bay.  

Comparisons between detided and biological \ac{DO} time series from the simulations indicated that adequate results can be obtained from the weighted regression for a range of characteristics of \ac{DO} time series, as well as half window widths used in the regression.  An examination of scenarios that produced abnormal results can provide additional insight into factors that affect the performance of weighted regression.  For example, poor performance was observed when the observation uncertainty ($\epsilon_{obs}$) was high and both process uncertainty ($\epsilon_{pro}$) and tidal advection ($DO_{adv}$) were low.  These examples represent time series with excessive random variation, no auto-correlation, and no tidal influence.  Poor performance is expected because the weighted regression models a non-existent tidal signal in a very noisy \ac{DO} time series.  These results were observed even for time series with a large diel component of the biological \ac{DO} signal, suggesting that the model will produce unreliable results in microtidal systems with high noise and no serial correlation.  From a practical perspective, weighted regression should not be applied to noisy time series if there is not sufficient evidence to suggest the variation is related to tidal changes.  Similarly, results with perfect or near-perfect correlations between detided and biological \ac{DO} time series were observed when observation uncertainy and tidal advection effects were not in the simulated time series.  Although there is no logical basis for applying weighted regression to time series with no apparent tidal influences, the results will be as expected, as was true for cases with low tidal advection, high observation uncertainty, and low process uncertainty.  We emphasize that the weighted regression should only be applied to time series for which specific conditions apply, as described below.  

The performance metrics used to evaluate weighted regression with the case studies suggested that detiding provided more accuate estimates of ecosystem metabolism.  Correlations of metabolism estimates with tidal height changes after detiding were generally reduced, although trends were not always consistent as correlations were reduced in some cases (Sapelo Island) or reversed in others (Padilla Bay).  However, correlations of net metabolism estimates were reduced in all cases.  Tidal height change provides a proxy measure for horizontal advection that directly affects the measured rate of change of oxygen.  Further, changes in \ac{DO} concentration represent integrated measures of both production and respiration (\cref{metrate}).  The inconsistent results in \cref{tab:cor_res} are potentially related to the effects of horizontal advection on the integrated \ac{DO} signal, given that production and respiration each represent a unique component of the diel \ac{DO} variation that is directly affected by tidal variation.  Regardless, the proportion of anomalous metabolism estimates was reduced by detiding for all case studies, although this measure may also be an incomplete indication of the combined effects of tidal variation.  Negative production and positive respiration estimates suggest assumptions of the open-water method are violated \citep{Needoba12}, whereas `normal' estimates (positive production and negative respiration) may still include a significant source of bias from physical advection by providing over-estimates of true values.  For example, \citet{Nidzieko14} observed that net metabolism at Elkhorn Slough was more often heterotrophic during maximum spring tides that occurred at nighttime, as a substantially larger area of salt marsh was inundated leading to higher respiration estimates.  Although this result supports our general conclusions, a broader discussion regarding whether or not this represents a bias in metabolism from physical advection may be needed. 

A strength of the weighted regression approach is the lack of assumptions for describing the relationships between \ac{DO} and tidal variation over time.  Although the functional form of the model is a simple linear regression with two explanatory variables (\cref{funform}), the moving window approach combined with the adaptive weighting scheme allows for quantification of complex tidal effects that may not be possible using alternative approaches.  For example, \citet{Batt12} described the use of a moving window or Kalman filter to improve estimates of ecosystem metabolism in lakes.  The approach minimizes the influences of process and observation uncertainty on observed \ac{DO} time series, which is attributed to the effects of water movement on metabolic signals.  Although a similar approach may be useful for estuaries if process and observation uncertainty are the only sources of variation in the \ac{DO} series, the weighted regression approach is more appropriate if tidal advection is the primary confounding factor.  Additionally, results from the case studies illustrated the ability of the weighted regression approach to model changes over time in the relationships between tidal change and \ac{DO}.  Results for Padilla Bay and Rookery Bay suggested that detiding had the largest effect during the summer, whereas the results for cooler months were not significantly different from the observed.  The weighted regression method produced detided time series that accommodated seasonal variation in \ac{DO} conditional on tidal height change, whereas moving window filters or standard regression techniques would likely not have characterized these dynamic relationships.
