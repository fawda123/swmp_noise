Results from the analysis of simulated data and case studies suggest that weighted regression is a useful approach for improving estimates of ecosystem metabolism by reducing the effects of tidal advection on \ac{DO} time series.  The weighted regression method dramatically reduced advection effects for some of the case studies, generating useful estimates of metabolism where otherwise open water metabolism estimates would be subject to significant errors.  Further analysis of the method illustrated the attributes of sites where it should be most useful and conversely, attributes of sites where problems may be encountered using the method.  The weighted regression method will work best at sites that have a medium or large effect of advection on \ac{DO}, but tidal changes are not correlated with the solar cycle for more than a few days.  At sites with a dominant semidiurnal tide, such as at Sapelo Island, Georgia, the method can be expected to dramatically improve analysis using open water metabolism.  Since this tidal regime occurs throughout the Atlantic coast of North America, Europe and Africa, as well as many other areas of the global coastline, this method should be broadly applicable, even if not universally applicable.  Where tidal effects on \ac{DO} time series are small, the method has the potential to reduce advection effects further, although the potential for improvement is smaller than at sites with more significant advection effects.  Where tides are large and strongly correlated with the solar cycle on seasonal time scales, the traditional open water metabolism method may be subject to very large errors.  This was observed at the Elkhorn Slough and Padilla Bay sites, which have mixed semidiurnal tides.  Tides with this pattern are characteristic of the Pacific coastline of North America and portions of east Asia, among others.  Unfortunately, the weighted regression method could not resolve which \ac{DO} changes resulted from advection and which resulted from metabolism at these sites because the patterns are excessively collinear.  As we implemented the method, the regression attributed most \ac{DO} variation at these sites to the tide, resulting in estimates of metabolism that are very small.  In these cases, the computed metabolism estimates after weighted regression are different from the original open water metabolism computations, but equally incorrect.

Tidal currents in estuaries can move water across a mosaic of habitat types that likely have different biological rates.  For example, the magnitudes of production and respiration, and the net metabolism may differ across salinity gradients, between open water and shallow water habitats, and inside and outside of tidal marshes and seagrass habitats.  These complex estuarine seascapes are especially prevalent at sites like those in the \ac{NERRS} network.  The interaction between spatial differences in metabolic processes and tidal advection moving water masses among habitats contributes to tidal artifacts in open water metabolism calculations.  Advection alone, such as in an open coastal environment might actually generate little distortion of the metabolic signal within the \ac{DO} record.  

The objective of the weighted regression method is the remove or reduce variations associated with tides, allowing for an improved estimate of the average metabolic rates between the ``end members'' that define the tidal excursion about the \ac{DO} sensor.  The method works because in most tidal regimes, tidal cycles pregress fully relative to the solar cycle within several weeks.  Pregression occurs quickly with semidiurnal tides and slightly more slowly with diurnal tides.  At time scales longer than this period, \ac{DO} variations associated with metabolism can be separated statistically from \ac{DO} variations associated with tides.  Locally-weighted regression is necessary because both the average metabolic rates associated with the solar cycle and the horizontal \ac{DO} gradients created by spatial differences in metabolism are variable in time.  The temporal scale and the choice of window width can be based on the time required for pregression of tides relative to the solar cycle.

Problems may arise in applying the method in certain situations, apparently most common with mixed tides, where complete phase pregression occurs across a seasonal time scales.  For example, \citet{Nidzieko14} showed that the higher high tide, which floods high marsh habitats, can occur at night in Elkhorn Slough throughout summer causing both real and apparent changes in metabolism.  Large errors in standard open water metabolism calculations result because tide is generally rising during afternoon and falling in the early hours of the day, amplifying the true metabolic signal.  Because the tide and solar cycle are correlated, however, our method ascribes all variability to the tide, resulting in equally unsatisfactory and large underestimates of rates.  Weighted regression could be used, but only at a very long time scale, where the benefits of using it are not as great.  As \citet{Nidzieko14} showed, these complex patterns are best quantified and understood with the benefit of a more detailed data set.

As a final note, it is worth mentioning that these computations are complex relative to the basic open water metabolism calculations which can be implemented by hand or in a spreadsheet.  However, because we implemented the analysis in R, the freely-available programming environment for statistical analysis, scientific computing and graphics \citepalias{RDCT14}, many users may be able to replicate the approach using a package provided in the supporting information.  As the original open-water metabolism computations have already been implemented in R and shared widely, the additional development of the method presented here could also be applied by using our code.
