Results from the simulations and case studies suggested that weighted regression can be a practical approach for detiding \ac{DO} time series to remove the effects of physical advection on estimates of ecosystem metabolism.  However, application of the method may only be appropriate under specific situations.  The case studies were chosen based on the expected influence of tidal variaiton given the relatively high proportion of metabolism estimates that were anomalous and the strength of correlation between the observed \ac{DO} time series and tidal height.  Despite these similarites among the case studies, detiding had variable effects on metabolism estimates.  The results for Elkhorn Slough and Padilla Bay are particular cause for concern given that mean annual estimates were substantially different compared to those from the observed \ac{DO} time series.  Although the correlation of \ac{DO} and tidal height was reduced for both cases, in addition to a reduction of anomalous estimates, the relative change in mean metabolism before and after detiding suggests a more careful evaluation of the method is needed.  In particular, optimal window widths should be chosen based on the ability to remove tidal effects while preserving the biological signal.  

The case studies emphasize a critical challenge in evaluating the effects of physical advection: the true biological signal is not known, or more appropriately, the relative contribution of horizontal advection to bias is not accuratley quantified.  Comparative analyses between systems with varying tidal influence or within-system evaluations of multiple sites at fixed distances are necessary to further validate performance of weighted regression.  Regardless, the current analysis suggests the method is potentially useful and we propose a precautionary approach for its application pending further validation.  Weighted regression should only be applied at macrotidal sites with strong evidence of the confounding effects of tidal advection on biological signals.  A weight-of-evidence approach should be used such that the occurrence of anomalous metabolism estimates, strong correlations between observed \ac{DO} and tide height, and clear visual patterns of tide change on \ac{DO} would suggest detiding is appropriate.  The choice of window widths may also produce varying results.  Optimal widths may be those that indicate a reduction of anomalous estimates, reduction in daily variation of production and respiration, and a reduction of the correlation between \ac{DO} and tide.  Results from window widths that produce large changes in the mean annual estimates should interpreted with caution.  In general, a pragmatic approach is emphasized such that results should be evaluated based on the preservation of diel variation related to production while exhibiting minimal changes with the tide.  Such an approach, combined with further validation, will support informed management decisions through more accurate estimates of ecosystem metabolism.
