Results from the simulations and case studies suggested that weighted regression can be a practical approach for filtering \ac{DO} time series to remove the effects of physical advection on estimates of ecosystem metabolism.  However, application of the method may only be appropriate under specific situations.  The case studies were chosen based on the relatively high proportion of metabolism estimates that were anomalous and the strength of correlation between the observed \ac{DO} time series and tidal height.  Despite these similarites among the case studies, filtering had variable effects on metabolism estimates.  The results for Elkhorn Slough and Padilla Bay are of particular concern given that mean annual estimates were substantially different compared to those from the observed \ac{DO} time series.  Although the correlation of \ac{DO} and tidal height was reduced for both cases, in addition to a reduction of anomalous estimates, the relative change in mean metabolism before and after filtering suggests a more careful evaluation of the method is needed.  In particular, alternative window widths should evaluated for the ability to remove tidal effects while preserving the biological signal.  The window widths in the above analysis may have removed variation in the \ac{DO} signal from both of these sources.    

Although the above analyses suggest the approach has merit, the case studies emphasize a critical challenge in applying weighted regression to monitoring data. Specifically, the true biological signal is not known and the relative contribution of horizontal advection to bias is not accurately quantified with the available data.  Comparative analyses between systems with varying tidal influence or within-system evaluations of multiple sites at fixed distances are necessary to further validate the performance of weighted regression.  In the absence of additional validation, we propose a precautionary approach for application of the weighted regression to monitoring data.  Weighted regression may be most effective at macrotidal sites with strong evidence of the effects of tidal advection on biological signals.  A weight-of-evidence approach should be used such that the occurrence of anomalous metabolism estimates, strong correlations between observed \ac{DO} and tide height, and clear visual patterns of tide change on \ac{DO} would suggest filtering is appropriate.  The choice of window widths may also produce varying results.  Window widths that produce large changes in mean annual estimates should be interpreted with caution.  In general, a pragmatic approach is emphasized such that results should be evaluated based on the preservation of diel variation from production while exhibiting minimal changes with the tide.  Such an approach, combined with further validation, will support informed management decisions through more accurate estimates of ecosystem metabolism.
