Results from the simulations and case studies suggested that weighted regression is a practical approach for detiding \ac{DO} time series to remove the effects of physical advection on estimates of ecosystem metabolism.  However, application of the method may only be appropriate under specific situations.  The case studies were chosen based on the expected influence of tidal variaiton given the relatively high proportion of metabolism estimates that were anomalous and the strength of correlation between the observed \ac{DO} time series and tidal height.  The results for Elkhorn Slough were cause for concern given that the detided metabolism estimates were substantially reduced compared to those from the observed \ac{DO} time series.  Although the correlation of \ac{DO} and tidal height was reduced, in addition to a reduction of anomalous estimates, the relative change in mean metabolism before and after detiding was unusually large.  The detiding results are highly sensitive to changes in the window widths, particularly the hour window.  Further investigation of the effects of different window widths on the metabolism estimates for Elkhorn Slough were unable to produce satisfactory results such that the metabolism estimates were significantly lower in all cases.  This suggests that the weighted regression was removing variation in the observed \ac{DO} related to both tidal changes and metabolic components.  

The results for Elkhorn Slough provide an example that emphasizes the need for restraint in applying weighted regression.  Because the true biological \ac{DO} signal is not known, no single measure can provide a true representation of the effectiveness of weighted regression.  Accordingly, we propose a precautionary approach that emphasizes application of the method following a set of conditions and steps.  First, weighted regression should only be applied at macrotidal sites and if there is strong evidence of the confounding effects of tidal advection.  The occurrence of anomalous estimates alone may not be sufficient for justifying use of the method.  A simple scatterplot of observed \ac{DO} versus tide height should indicate a strong correlation, in addition to clear visual patterns of tide change on \ac{DO}.  Second, significant changes in mean metabolic rates before and after detiding warrants a more comprehensive application of the method, with attention on specific window widths.  Changes in mean annual rates are of particular concern, which suggest that the method has reduced both physical and biological variation in the \ac{DO} signal.  Third, optimal results may be those that indicate a reduction of anomalous estimates, reduction in daily variation of production and respiration, and a reduction of the correlation between \ac{DO} and tide.  In general, a pragmatic approach is emphasized such that results based on detided estimates should be evaluated for the preservation of diel variation while exhibiting minimal changes with the tide.  Such an approach will support more accurate estimates of ecosystem metabolism that fulfill assumptions of the open-water method.
