Results from the simulations and case studies suggested that weighted regression can be a practical approach for filtering \ac{DO} time series.  However, application may only be appropriate under specific situations.  The case studies were chosen based on the relatively high proportion of metabolism estimates that were anomalous and the strength of correlation between the observed \ac{DO} time series and tidal height.  Despite these similarites, filtering had variable effects on metabolism estimates.  The results for Elkhorn Slough and Padilla Bay are of particular concern given that mean annual estimates were substantially different compared to those from the observed \ac{DO} time series.  Although the correlation of \ac{DO} and tidal height was reduced for both cases, in addition to a reduction of anomalous estimates, collinearity between tidal change and solar cycling likely contributed to the relative change in mean metabolism before and after filtering.  Evaluating collinearity, as in \cref{fig:move_corrs}, is an important diagnostic for characterizing the expected performance of weighted regression and choosing appropriate window widths.  These plots should indicate whether weighted regression is appropriate for the whole time series (e.g., Sapelo Island) or only for specific periods when collinearity is low (e.g., April and October at Elkhorn Slough).  A weight-of-evidence approach should also be used such that application of weighted regression should reduce anomalous metabolism estimates, minimize correlations between observed \ac{DO} and tide height, and reduce clear visual patterns of tide change on \ac{DO}.  In general, a pragmatic approach is emphasized such that results should be evaluated based on the preservation of diel variation from production while exhibiting minimal changes with the tide.  Such an approach, combined with further validation, will support informed management decisions through more accurate estimates of ecosystem metabolism.
