In aquatic ecosystems, time series of \ac{DO} have been used to compute estimates of ecosystem metabolism.  Central to this open water or `Odum' method is the assumption that the dissolved oxygen time series is a Lagrangian specification of the flow field.  However, most \ac{DO} time series are collected at fixed locations, such that changes in dissolved oxygen are assumed to reflect metabolism and that effects of advection or mixing can be neglected.  A statistical model using weighted regression was applied to separate variability in \ac{DO} from tidal variation or other advection in estuaries, thereby helping to partially relax this assumption and improve metabolism estimates. The method explicitly targets the tidal component using a flexible association while preserving the true biological signal, offering a distinct advantage over traditional deconvulution methods. The model was developed and tested using simulated \ac{DO} time series with known biological and physical components, and then applied to one year of continuous monitoring data from four stations within the \acl*{NERRS}.  Variability resulting from advection was reduced in all cases, greatly reducing the correlation of \ac{DO} and metabolism estimates with tides. The model was especially effective when the magnitude of tidal influence was high and correlations between tidal change and the solar cycle were low at the time scales of interest.  When tides and the solar cycle were correlated for protracted periods, the model was less useful. By reducing the effects of physical transport on metabolism estimates, there may be increased potential to empirically relate metabolic rates to causal factors on timescales of several days to several weeks.
