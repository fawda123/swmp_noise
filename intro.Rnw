Time series of dissolved oxygen are increasingly used to estimate ecosystem metabolism \citep{Kemp12,Needoba12}.  Integrated measures of metabolism describe the balance between production and respiration processes that create and consume organic matter, respectively.  Although metabolic rates vary naturally at different spatial and temporal scales \citep{Ziegler98,Caffrey04,Russell07}, anthropogenic nutrient sources are often contributing factors that increase rates of production (\citealt{Nixon95}, \citetalias{NRC00}).  Inputs of limiting nutrients beyond background concentrations may decrease the resilience of an ecosystem such that higher rates of production are coupled with higher biological oxygen demand \citep{Yin04,Kemp09}.  Cultural eutrophication is frequently linked to declines in water quality through lower levels of dissolved oxygen, degradation in aquatic vegetation habitat, and increased frequency of harmful algal blooms \citep{Cloern96,Short96,Rabalais02,Diaz08}.  Reliables estimates of ecosystem metabolism are critical for measuring both background rates of production and potential impacts of human activities on ecosytem condition.     

Open-water techniques have been used for decades to infer metabolic rates using \textit{in situ} measurements from continuous monitoring data \citep{Odum56}. Daily integrated measurements of metabolism represent the balance between daytime production and nighttime respiration.  The open-water method uses the diel fluctuation of dissolved oxygen to estimate ecosytem metabolism, after correcting for air-water gas exchange \citep{Kemp12}.  Originally conceived for streams \citep{Odum56}, the open-water method has been used with varying success in lakes \citep{Staehr10,Coloso11,Batt12} and estuaries \citep{Caffrey04,Russell07,Caffrey13}.  As with any method, the ability to accurately estimate whole system metabolism depends on the degree to which assumptions of the theory are met.  Such assumptions are often only implicity verified in practice, leading to potential biases.  The fundamental assumption is that the time series of \ac{DO} describes the same water mass over time \citep{Needoba12}.  Estimates of metabolism may be inaccurate if substantial variation in water column mixing occurs throughout the period of observation \citep{Russell07}.  Numerous studies have shown that application of the open-water method to lakes or estuaries may be problematic given the potential effects of physical mixing \citep{Ziegler98,Caffrey03,Coloso11,Batt12,Nidzieko14}.  

An extensive analysis by \citet{Caffrey03} applied the open-water method to estimate metabolism at 28 continuous monitoring stations at 14 US estuaries.  An important observation from this study regarding the utility of the open-water method was that a significant portion of the estimates were negative (3 - 69\% depending on site). Significant variation from advection of water masses with different metabolic histories was suggested as a likely factor influencing the \ac{DO} time series. Inaccurate air-sea exchange estimates may have also contributed to these seemingly anomalous values.  Further, \citet{Nidzieko14} evaluated the effects of tidal advection on metabolism estimates in a mesotidal estuary.  Estimates were strongly correlated with the spring-neap cycle such that net heterotrophy was more common during spring tides, whereas metabolism was generally balanced during neap tides. These studies provide compelling examples of the importance of potential noise in metabolism estimates related to physical advection.  The increasing availability of large, multi-annual datasets further warrants a need for quantiative methods that improve the accuracy of estimates of biological process rates.  \citet{Batt12} acknowledged this need by applying a Kalman filter \citep{Harvey89} to remove process and observation uncertainty from \ac{DO} time series in lakes.  Similar approaches have not been developed for estuaries, particularly those that account for cyclicity in time series associated with tidal variation in addition to process and observation uncertainty.

This article describes the application of a method for filtering an observed \ac{DO} time series for estimated tidal effects to more accurately quantify estimates of ecosystem metabolism for estuaries.  Specifically, the apparent effects of tidal advection on \ac{DO} observations are removed to improve the fidelity of open-water metabolism estimates derived from continuous water quality data.  We used a weighted regression approach originally developed to resolve trends in pollutant concentrations in streams and rivers \citep{Hirsch10}.  The weighted regression approach creates dynamic predictions of \ac{DO} as a function of time and tidal height change, which are then used to filter, or detide, the \ac{DO} signal.  First, we used simulated \ac{DO} time series with known characteristics to evaluate ability of the weighted regression to remove the simulated effects of a tidally-advected \ac{DO} gradient.  Second, the simulation results informed the application of the method to four case studies chosen from the \aclu{NERRS} (\acs{NERRS}, \citealt{Wenner04}).  Specifically, one year of \ac{DO} time series for each case study was filtered to adjust estimates of ecosystem metabolism to apparent tidal effects.  In all examples, tidal height is used as a proxy for lateral water movements that may influence \ac{DO} observations.  In the absence of quantitative data describing lateral \ac{DO} variation (e.g., contemporaneous data along a tidal axis), we assume that tidal height is an appropriate and approximate measure that characterizes effects of physical advection.  Accordingly, `tidal variation' or `changes in tidal height' are used throughout in reference to assumed lateral \ac{DO} gradients that are carried past monitoring sensors by tidal currents.  Overall, the analysis is meant to better characterize the relative roles of biological and physical processes in estuarine systems.
