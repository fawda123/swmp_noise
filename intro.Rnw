Ecosystem metabolism describes the balance between production and respiration processes that create and consume organic matter \citep{Kemp12,Needoba12}.  Light exposure experiments of water samples collected at discrete locations and times have traditionally been used to measure metabolic activity \citep{Gaarder27}.  Although highly controlled and precise, bottle-based methods are labor-intensive and not scalable to describe entire ecosystem rates.  Bottle-based methods may also only reliably estimate production and respiration associated with planktonic processes, whereas significant contributions to ecosystem metabolism can arise from other habitats, such as the benthos or intertidal marshes.  By contrast, open-water techniques have been increasingly used to estimate whole system metabolism given the availability of long-term, continuous time series of dissolved oxygen \citep{Odum56,Davanzo96}. Daily integrated measurements of metabolism represent the balance between daytime production and nighttime respiration attributed to all ecosystem components. Open-water estimates also provide a more accessible means of tracking ecosystem change over time as compared to discrete sampling events with bottle-based approaches. Although metabolic rates vary naturally at different spatial and temporal scales \citep{Ziegler98,Caffrey04,Russell07}, anthropogenic nutrient sources are often contributing factors that increase rates of production (\citealt{Nixon95}; \citetalias{NRC00}).  Reliable estimates of whole ecosystem metabolism are critical for measuring both background rates of production and potential impacts of human activities on ecosytem function.     

The ability to accurately estimate whole system metabolism using the open-water method depends on the degree to which assumptions of the theory are satisfied \citep{Staehr10,Kemp12}.  The fundamental assumption is that the time series of \ac{DO} represents a Lagrangian specification of the flow field \citep{Needoba12}.  The Lagrangian specification characterizes an individual fluid parcel through time, such as a parcel of water moving with the tide.  In reality, most \ac{DO} time series are collected at fixed locations such as a mooring or dock, so they are a Eulerian specification of the flow field.  Time series at fixed locations may characterize water masses with different metabolic histories as water is advected past the sensor, leading to errors in metabolism estimates \citep{Kemp80,Russell07}.  Given this critical challenge, the open-water method has been used with varying success in estuaries influenced by tidal transport and mixing \citep{Caffrey04,Russell07,Caffrey14}.  In contrast, the method has been more successfully applied to water quality time series in lakes, although stratification may limit estimates to specific vertical layers \citep{Staehr10,Coloso11,Batt12}. Appropriate placement of monitoring sondes, sampling frequency and duration, and reliability of data from single stations have been relevant issues in applying the open-water method to systems influenced by physical mixing \citep{Russell07,Staehr10}.  Individual sampling stations near bay inlets or along major tidal axes may produce \ac{DO} time series that are strongly influenced by advection, leading to relatively large errors when using the open-water method.   

Although numerous studies have shown that application of the open-water method to lakes or estuaries may be problematic \citep{Ziegler98,Caffrey03,Coloso11,Batt12,Nidzieko14}, very few quantitative approaches have been developed to address potential bias or noise in metabolism estimates resulting from advection.  For example, an extensive analysis by \citet{Caffrey03} applied the open-water method to estimate metabolism at 28 continuous monitoring stations at 14 US estuaries.  A significant portion of the production and respiration estimates were negative (3 - 69\% depending on site), suggesting advection of water masses was a likely a major factor influencing the \ac{DO} time series.  These `anomalous' values are typically omitted from the analysis \citep{Caffrey03,Collins13}, which may upwardly bias estimates of mean metabolism \citep{Caffrey14}.  Further, \citet{Nidzieko14} evaluated the effects of tidal advection on metabolism estimates in a mesotidal estuary.  Estimates from a single location were strongly correlated with the spring-neap cycle such that net heterotrophy was more common during spring tides, whereas metabolism was generally balanced during neap tides.  This example illustrates that metabolism may actually be modulated by the tide, as opposed to artifacts in the \ac{DO} time series caused by advection on daily time scales.  \citet{Nidzieko14} used a control-volume approach by impounding a section of the upper estuary to understand how physical processes contribute to biological variability.  Although useful as an \textit{in situ}, site-specific approach, more accessible statistical methods specific to time series are needed given the increasing availability of continuous monitoring data. For example, \citet{Batt12} explored the use of a Kalman filter \citep{Harvey89} to remove process and observation uncertainty from \ac{DO} time series in lakes.  Similar approaches have not been developed for estuaries, particularly those that address potential effects of tidal advection.

This article describes the development and application of a method for improving estimates of ecosytem metabolism computed from \ac{DO} time series by reducing the effect of tidal advection on continuous \ac{DO} observations.  We used a weighted regression approach originally developed to resolve trends in pollutant concentrations in streams and rivers \citep{Hirsch10}.  The weighted regression approach creates dynamic predictions of \ac{DO} as a function of time and tidal height change, which are then used to filter, or detide, the \ac{DO} signal.  The model is based on the recognition that daily fluctuations in \ac{DO} caused by metabolism are associated with the solar cycle, whereas other fluctuations in estuaries are likely associated with cyclical water level changes that generally exhibit pregression relative to the solar cycle.  The weighted regression model was applied, rather than methods commonly used for detiding in physical oceanography, to allow for the complex and dynamic patterns of \ac{DO} changes relative to advection.  The method targets the tidal component as an explicit variable using dynamic model parameters that change with location in the time series.  This allows an isolation of the biological component of the \ac{DO} time series that is independent of advection.  As a result, the weighted regression approach can preserve the true biological signal rather than risking removal of both the biological and physical components as with traditional deconvulution methods.  This offers an advantage for estuaries where the magnitude of tidal effects on water quality observations can be larger than in offshore or coastal environments.  During initial method development, we used simulated \ac{DO} time series with known characteristics to evaluate the ability of the weighted regression to remove the simulated effects of a tidally-advected \ac{DO} gradient.  Subsequently, the simulation results informed further development of the method as applied to four case studies chosen from the \aclu{NERRS} (\acs{NERRS}, \citealt{Wenner04}).  In all examples, tidal height is used as a proxy for advection because it was recorded with the \ac{NERRS} data.  In the absence of quantitative data describing lateral \ac{DO} variation (e.g., contemporaneous stations along a tidal axis), the model determines the advective effect empirically.
