Ecosystem metabolism is broadly defined as the difference between primary production and aerobic respiration and provides a basis for evaluating trophic state \citep{Kemp12,Needoba12}.  Primary producers, such as phytoplankton, establish the means of energy transfer to upper trophic levels. Productive systems are characterized by more efficient transfer of organic matter between trophic levels, whereas less productive systems are sinks of organic matter that are supported by allochthonous sources of energy input.  The balance between production and respiration is an integrated measure of metabolism that accounts for varying rates in processes that create and consume organic matter.  Although metabolic rates vary naturally in different regions \citep{Caffrey04}, human activities and infrastructure development are contributing factors that increase rates of production \citep{Diaz08}.  Inputs of limiting nutrients beyond background concentrations may decrease the resilience of an ecosystem such that higher rates of production are coupled with higher biological oxygen demand \citep{Yin04,Kemp09}.  Cultural eutrophication is frequently linked to declines in water quality through lower levels of dissolved oxygen and increased frequency of noxious algal blooms.  Reliables estimates of ecosystem metabolism are critical for measuring both background rates of production and potential impacts of human activities on ecosytem condition.     

Ecosystem metabolism can be estimated using several techniques, each of which is appropriate under different conditions or assumptions.   Bottle-based techniques rely on rate measurements from discrete water quality samples, whereas open-water techniques infer metabolic rates using \textit{in situ} measurements from continuous monitoring data.  Bottle-based techniques are useful for direct partitioning of metabolic contributions into discrete habitats, such as planktonic production rates during specific time periods \citep{Kemp12}.  However, such measurements may be inappropriate for evaluating whole ecosystem metabolism if significant production occurs in habitats that are not sampled, such as benthic or seagrass production.  As such, the open-water technique provides an integrative measure of metabolism by inferring process rates from \textit{in situ}, continuous monitoring data.  Originally proposed for use in streams \citep{Odum56}, the method has been used with varying success in lakes \citep{Staehr10,Coloso11,Batt12} and estuaries \citep{Caffrey04,Hopkinson05,Caffrey13}.  The ability of the open-water method to accurately estimate metabolism depends on whether the assumptions for its use are met, which are often only implicity verified in practiced. 

The open-water method uses the diel fluctuation of dissolved oxygen to infer rates of ecosytem metabolism, after correcting for losses or gains through air-water exchange \citep{Kemp12}.  Daily integrated measurements of metabolism are based on the balance between daytime estimates of gross production and nighttime estimates of respiration extrapolated to a 24 hour period.  The fundamental assumption of the open-water method is that measurements come from a water mass that has the same recent history \citep{Needoba12}.  Estimates of metabolism from a single location may be inaccurate if substantial variation in water column mixing occurs throughout the period of observation.  As such, the original technique designed for use in streams requires the comparison of data from an upstream and downstream station \citep{Odum56}.  Application of the method to systems without continuous flow, such as lakes or estuaries, have often assumed that a single sampling station provides sufficient data for estimating metabolism \cite{Staehr10}.  While single stations may be valid under specific conditions, numerous studies have shown that the open-water method may be inappropriate given the effects of physical mixing \citep{Ziegler98,Caffrey03,Coloso11,Batt12,Nidzieko14}.

The open-water method has recently been applied to coastal and oceanic ecosystems with mixed success.  An exhaustive analysis by \citet{Caffrey03} applied the method to estimate metabolim at 28 continuous monitoring stations at 14 US estuaries.  Data from two of the reserves were used to evaluate the assumption of homogeneity of water masses measured by each sensor.  Although significant differences were not observed for metabolism estimates between adjacent stations, the analysis was based on a comparison of means using conventional significance tests rather than a systematic comparison of time series.  Moreover, a portion of metabolism estimates from all stations were negative for production during the day and positive for respiration during the night.  These values were opposite in sign than expected since production increases oxygen during the day (i.e., positive effect on metabolism) and respiration consumes oxygen at night (i.e., negative effect on metabolism).  These `anamolous' values were attributed to violations in the assumption of water-column heterogeneity.  Specifically, tidal variation could have caused sampling of different water masses by individual water quality sondes as water moved inland or seaward with changing tide. 

The effects of tidal advection on estimates of ecosystem metabolism have been a point of concern in numerous studies \citep{Ziegler98,Caffrey03,Collins13,Howarth14}, although systematic estimates of its effects and methods for accounting for physical variation in \ac{DO} measurements have been minimal.  An exception is presented by \citet{Nidzieko14} through quantitative assessment of the effects of fortnightly tidal modulations on metabolism estimates.  Using a control volume approach to measure fluxes into and out of a shallow tidal creek, significant biases in metabolism estimates were observed.  Net heterotrophy was observed during spring tides, whereas metabolism was balanced during neap tides.  The timing of irradiance relative to the tidal cycle was a primary factor contributing to heterotrophy during summer months such that maximum tides occurred during the night, increasing total area for respiration.  The results of the analysis, although specific to the study location, suggest that the effects of tidal advection on \ac{DO} measurements are of primary concern when selecting locations and length of time for sonde deployment in estuaries.  In many cases, the relative magnitude of these effects may be a significant source of bias without quantitative evaluation to determine the roles of biological and physical signals in \ac{DO} measurements. Analytical techniques to evaluate and correct for tidal advection could improve certainty in metabolism estimates and also increase the use of data from shorter deployment periods if sources of bias are quantified and removed.       

This article describes use of a novel method for quantifying and removing noise in estimates of ecosystem metabolim for estuaries.  Specifically, we characterize the effects of tidal advection on \ac{DO} observations to improve estimates of open-water metabolism with multi-year time series of high frequency ($<$ one hour) water quality data.  The focus of our analysis is the use of a weighted regression method previously developed for trend analysis of pollutant concentrations in streams and rivers \citep{Hirsch10}.  A weighted regression approach is applied to create dynamic predictions of \ac{DO} as a function of time and tidal height change, which is then used to normalize, or detide, the \ac{DO} signal.  The analysis is presented in two steps.  First, we apply a simulation approach to create time series of \ac{DO} observations with known characteristics to evaluate ability of the weighted regression to predict the time series and remove the effects of tidal advection.  Second, four case studies of multi-year time series are used to further explore use of the weighted regression approach to remove potential noise in \ac{DO} signals from tidal advection.  Comparisons of observed and detided \ac{DO} values are compared, in addition to estimates of open-water metabolism before and after detiding of the \ac{DO} time series.  Overall, the analysis provides a means to improve certainty in conclusions from observed \ac{DO} for evaluating the relative roles of biological and physical processes in estuarine systems.  Applications of the weighted regression approach are expected to have wide-ranging implications for management and ecosystem monitoring by outlining strategies for obtaining water quality estimates with more accuracy.
