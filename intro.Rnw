Time series of dissolved oxygen are increasingly used to estimate ecosystem metabolism \citep{Kemp12,Needoba12}.  Integrated measures of metabolism describe the balance between production and respiration processes that create and consume organic matter, respectively.  Although metabolic rates vary naturally between systems \citep{Ziegler98,Caffrey04,Russell07}, anthropogenic nutrient sources are often contributing factors that increase rates of production \citep{Diaz08}.  Inputs of limiting nutrients beyond background concentrations may decrease the resilience of an ecosystem such that higher rates of production are coupled with higher biological oxygen demand \citep{Yin04,Kemp09}.  Cultural eutrophication is frequently linked to declines in water quality through lower levels of dissolved oxygen, degradation in aquatic vegetation habitat, and increased frequency of harmful algal blooms \citep{Cloern96,Short96,Rabalais02}.  Reliables estimates of ecosystem metabolism are critical for measuring both background rates of production and potential impacts of human activities on ecosytem condition.     

Ecosystem metabolism can be estimated using two basic techniques, each of which is appropriate under different conditions or assumptions \citep{Kemp12}.   Bottle-based techniques rely on rate measurements from discrete water quality samples, whereas open-water techniques infer metabolic rates using \textit{in situ} measurements from continuous monitoring data.  Bottle-based techniques partition metabolic contributions into discrete habitats, such as pelagic production rates during specific time periods \citep{Kemp12}.  However, such measurements cannot estimate whole ecosystem metabolism if significant metabolism occurs in habitats that are not sampled, such as the benthos.  As such, open-water metabolism provides an integrative measure of process rates from \textit{in situ}, continuous monitoring data.  Originally conceived for streams \citep{Odum56}, the open-water method has been used with varying success in lakes \citep{Staehr10,Coloso11,Batt12} and estuaries \citep{Caffrey04,Hopkinson05,Caffrey13}.  As with any method, the ability to accurately estimate whole system metabolism depends on the degree to which assumptions of the theory are met.  Such assumptions are often only implicity verified in practice, leading to potential biases.

The open-water method uses the diel fluctuation of dissolved oxygen to infer rates of ecosytem metabolism, after correcting for air-water gas exchange \citep{Kemp12}.  Daily integrated measurements of metabolism represent the balance between daytime production and nighttime respiration.  The fundamental assumption is that the time series of \ac{DO} describes the same water mass over time \citep{Needoba12}.  Estimates of metabolism from a single location may be inaccurate if substantial variation in water column mixing occurs throughout the period of observation \citep{Russell07}.  Application to lakes or estuaries have often assumed that a single sampling station provides sufficient data for estimating metabolism \cite{Staehr10}.  While single stations may be valid under specific conditions, numerous studies have shown that the open-water method may be inappropriate given the effects of physical mixing in lakes or estuaries \citep{Ziegler98,Caffrey03,Coloso11,Batt12,Nidzieko14}.  An extensive analysis by \citet{Caffrey03} applied the open-water method to estimate metabolim at 28 continuous monitoring stations at 14 US estuaries.  A significant portion of the estimates were negative for production and positive for respiration, i.e., opposite in sign given the assumptions of the method.  These `anamolous' values were attributed to the effects of tidal advection such that water masses with different metabolic histories were sampled at multiple sites.  Moreover, anomalous estimates were included in annual averages of ecosystem metabolism such that inferred rates could have been biased.

The effects of tidal advection on estimates of ecosystem metabolism have been emphasized in numerous studies \citep{Ziegler98,Collins13,Howarth14,Nidzieko14}, although systematic estimates of its effects have been minimal.  Analytical techniques to evaluate and correct for tidal advection could improve certainty in metabolism estimates and increase the use of data from shorter deployment periods if sources of bias are removed.  This article describes the application of a method for filtering an observed \ac{DO} time series for estimated tidal effects to more accurately quantify estimates of ecosystem metabolim for estuaries.  Specifically, the effects of tidal advection on \ac{DO} observations are removed to improve estimates of open-water metabolism with continuous water quality data.  We use a weighted regression approach developed to resolve trends in pollutant concentrations in streams and rivers \citep{Hirsch10}.  The weighted regression approach creates dynamic predictions of \ac{DO} as a function of time and tidal height change, which are then used to filter, or detide, the \ac{DO} signal.  First, we use a simulation approach to create time series of \ac{DO} observations with known characteristics to evaluate ability of the weighted regression to remove the effects of tidal advection.  Second, four case studies were chosen from the \aclu{NERRS} (\acs{NERRS}, \citealt{Wenner04}) to illustrate the method for adjusting estimates of ecosystem metabolism.  Overall, the analysis is meant to better characterize the relative roles of biological and physical processes in estuarine systems.
