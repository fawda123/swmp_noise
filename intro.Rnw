Time series of dissolved oxygen are increasingly used to estimate ecosystem metabolism \citep{Kemp12,Needoba12}.  Integrated measures of metabolism describe the balance between production and respiration processes that create and consume organic matter, respectively.  Although metabolic rates vary naturally between systems \citep{Ziegler98,Caffrey04,Russell07}, anthropogenic nutrient sources are often contributing factors that increase rates of production \citep{Diaz08}.  Inputs of limiting nutrients beyond background concentrations may decrease the resilience of an ecosystem such that higher rates of production are coupled with higher biological oxygen demand \citep{Yin04,Kemp09}.  Cultural eutrophication is frequently linked to declines in water quality through lower levels of dissolved oxygen, degradation in aquatic vegetation habitat, and increased frequency of harmful algal blooms \citep{Cloern96,Short96,Rabalais02}.  Reliables estimates of ecosystem metabolism are critical for measuring both background rates of production and potential impacts of human activities on ecosytem condition.     

Open-water techniques have been used for decades to infer metabolic rates using \textit{in situ} measurements from continuous monitoring data \citep{Odum56}. Daily integrated measurements of metabolism represent the balance between daytime production and nighttime respiration.  The open-water method uses the diel fluctuation of dissolved oxygen to estimate ecosytem metabolism, after correcting for air-water gas exchange \citep{Kemp12}.  Originally conceived for streams \citep{Odum56}, the open-water method has been used with varying success in lakes \citep{Staehr10,Coloso11,Batt12} and estuaries \citep{Caffrey04,Hopkinson05,Caffrey13}.  As with any method, the ability to accurately estimate whole system metabolism depends on the degree to which assumptions of the theory are met.  Such assumptions are often only implicity verified in practice, leading to potential biases.  The fundamental assumption is that the time series of \ac{DO} describes the same water mass over time \citep{Needoba12}.  Estimates of metabolism from a single location may be inaccurate if substantial variation in water column mixing occurs throughout the period of observation \citep{Russell07}.  Application to lakes or estuaries have often assumed that a single sampling station provides sufficient data for estimating metabolism \cite{Staehr10}.  While single stations may be valid under specific conditions, numerous studies have shown that application of the open-water method to lakes or estuaries may be inappropriate given the effects of physical mixing \citep{Ziegler98,Caffrey03,Coloso11,Batt12,Nidzieko14}.  

An extensive analysis by \citet{Caffrey03} applied the open-water method to estimate metabolism at 28 continuous monitoring stations at 14 US estuaries.  A significant portion of the estimates were negative for production and positive for respiration, i.e., opposite in sign given the assumptions of the method.  These `anamolous' values were attributed to the effects of tidal advection such that water masses with different metabolic histories were sampled at multiple sites. Further, \citet{Nidzieko14} evaluated the effects of tidal advection on metabolism estimates in a mesotidal estuary.  Estimates were strongly correlated with the spring-neap cycle such that net heterotrophy was more common during spring tides, whereas metabolism was generally balanced during neap tides. These studies provide compelling examples of the importance of potential bias in metabolism estimates related to physical advection.  The increasing availability of large, multi-annual datasets further warrants a need for quantiative methods that improve the accuracy of estimates of biological process rates.  \citet{Batt12} acknowledged this need by applying a Kalman filter \citep{Harvey89} to remove process and observation uncertainty from \ac{DO} time series in lakes.  Similar approaches have not been developed for estuaries, particularly those that account for cyclicity in time series associated with tidal variation in addition to process and observation uncertainty.

This article describes the application of a method for filtering an observed \ac{DO} time series for estimated tidal effects to more accurately quantify estimates of ecosystem metabolism for estuaries.  Specifically, the effects of tidal advection on \ac{DO} observations are removed to improve estimates of open-water metabolism with continuous water quality data.  We use a weighted regression approach developed to resolve trends in pollutant concentrations in streams and rivers \citep{Hirsch10}.  The weighted regression approach creates dynamic predictions of \ac{DO} as a function of time and tidal height change, which are then used to filter, or detide, the \ac{DO} signal.  First, we use a simulation approach to create time series of \ac{DO} observations with known characteristics to evaluate ability of the weighted regression to remove the effects of tidal advection.  Second, four case studies were chosen from the \aclu{NERRS} (\acs{NERRS}, \citealt{Wenner04}) to illustrate the method for adjusting estimates of ecosystem metabolism.  Overall, the analysis is meant to better characterize the relative roles of biological and physical processes in estuarine systems.
