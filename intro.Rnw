Metabolism estimates from time series of dissolved oxygen provide integrated estimates of production in aquatic ecosystems \citep{Kemp12,Needoba12}.  Autotrophic or productive systems are characterized by high rates of energy transfer between trophic levels leading to accumulation of organic matter, whereas heterotrophic systems are sinks of organic matter that are supported by allochthonous sources of energy input.  Integrated measures of metabolism describe the balance between production and respiration that accounts for varying rates in processes that create and consume organic matter.  Although metabolic rates vary naturally at multiple spatiotemporal scales \citep{Ziegler98,Caffrey04,Russell07}, anthropogenic stressors are often contributing factors that increase rates of production \citep{Diaz08}.  Inputs of limiting nutrients beyond background concentrations may decrease the resilience of an ecosystem such that higher rates of production are coupled with higher biological oxygen demand \citep{Yin04,Kemp09}.  Cultural eutrophication is frequently linked to declines in water quality through lower levels of dissolved oxygen, degradation in aquatic vegetation habitat, and increased frequency of harmful algal blooms \citep{Cloern96,Short96,Rabalais02}.  Reliables estimates of ecosystem metabolism are critical for measuring both background rates of production and potential impacts of human activities on ecosytem condition.     

Ecosystem metabolism can be estimated using two basic techniques, each of which is appropriate under different conditions or assumptions \citep{Kemp12}.   Bottle-based techniques rely on rate measurements from discrete water quality samples, whereas open-water techniques infer metabolic rates using \textit{in situ} measurements from continuous monitoring data.  Bottle-based techniques are useful for partitioning metabolic contributions into discrete habitats, such as pelagic production rates during specific time periods \citep{Kemp12}.  However, such measurements may be insufficient for evaluating whole ecosystem metabolism if significant production occurs in habitats that are not sampled, such as the benthos.  As such, the open-water technique provides an integrative measure of metabolism by inferring process rates from \textit{in situ}, continuous monitoring data.  Originally for use in streams \citep{Odum56}, the method has been used with varying success in lakes \citep{Staehr10,Coloso11,Batt12} and estuaries \citep{Caffrey04,Hopkinson05,Caffrey13}.  As with any method, the ability of the open-water technique to accurately estimate whole system metabolism depends on whether the assumptions for its use are not violated.  Such assumptions are often only implicity verified in practice, leading to potential biases.

The open-water method uses the diel fluctuation of dissolved oxygen to infer rates of ecosytem metabolism, after correcting for losses or gains through air-water exchange \citep{Kemp12}.  Daily integrated measurements of metabolism represent the balance between daytime estimates of gross production and nighttime estimates of respiration.  The fundamental assumption is that \ac{DO} measurements describe the same water mass over time \citep{Needoba12}.  Estimates of metabolism from a single location may be inaccurate if substantial variation in water column mixing occurs throughout the period of observation \citep{Russell07}.  Application of the technique to estimate metabolism in streams requires the comparison of data from an upstream and downstream station \citep{Odum56}.  Application to lakes or estuaries have often assumed that a single sampling station provides sufficient data for estimating metabolism \cite{Staehr10}.  While single stations may be valid under specific conditions, numerous studies have shown that the open-water method may be inappropriate given the effects of physical mixing in lakes or estuaries \citep{Ziegler98,Caffrey03,Coloso11,Batt12,Nidzieko14}.  An exhaustive analysis by \citet{Caffrey03} applied the open-water method to estimate metabolim at 28 continuous monitoring stations at 14 US estuaries.  A non-trivial portion of the estimates were negative for production during the day and positive for respiration during the night.  These `anamolous' values were attributed to the effects of tidal advection such that water masses with different metabolic histories were sampled at multiple sites. 

The effects of tidal advection on estimates of ecosystem metabolism have been a point of concern in numerous studies \citep{Monbet92,Ziegler98,Caffrey03,Collins13,Howarth14}, although systematic estimates of its effects have been minimal.  Analytical techniques to evaluate and correct for tidal advection could improve certainty in metabolism estimates and increase the use of data from shorter deployment periods if sources of bias are removed.  This article describes the theory and application of a method for detiding an observed \ac{DO} time series to more accurately quantify estimates of ecosystem metabolim for estuaries.  Specifically, the method characterizes the effects of tidal advection on \ac{DO} observations to improve estimates of open-water metabolism with multi-year time series of high frequency ($<$ one hour) water quality data.  The focus of our analysis is the use of a weighted regression method previously developed for trend analysis of pollutant concentrations in streams and rivers \citep{Hirsch10} and recently adapted for trend evaluation of water quality in estuaries \citepalias{BeckIR}.  The weighted regression approach creates dynamic predictions of \ac{DO} as a function of time and tidal height change, which are then used to normalize, or detide, the \ac{DO} signal.  First, we use a simulation approach to create time series of \ac{DO} observations with known characteristics to evaluate ability of the weighted regression to remove the effects of tidal advection.  Second, four case studies from the \aclu{NERRS} (\acs{NERRS}, \citealt{Wenner04}) are used to validate the method for improving estimates of ecosystem metabolism.  Overall, the analysis is meant to improve the certainty of information obtained from monitoring data by evaluating the relative roles of biological and physical processes in estuarine systems.  Applications are expected to have implications for ecosystem management by outlining strategies for interpreting water quality data with more accuracy.
